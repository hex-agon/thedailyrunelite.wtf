#### What is the daily runelite wtf?
This site is a fun site similar to thedailywtf, but only RuneLite related submissions are allowed. 
It started as a joke on the discord but now it actually exists!

Following RuneLite's spirit, this site is open source and build using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and the repository is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/hex-agon/thedailyrunelite.wtf). 
Any kind of contribution is welcome, be it posts, theme tweaks or site structure changes.

#### Submission rules
* Content must be related to RuneLite
* Names must be censored

#### Creating a new post
Even though posts are written with markdown, we recommended that you use Hugo so you can get a live preview of what you're writing.
A Hugo quickstart guide can be found [here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) (You should skip steps 2 & 3).
**Note that you must install Hugo extended as the site uses sass pre-processing.**
